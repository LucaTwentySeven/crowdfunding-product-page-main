## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Still learning Flexbox. In this example flex order and flex-grow trained.

Hard work with Javascript...

```html
<div class="modal--flex">
<div class="box__radio">
```

```css
.box__radio {
    flex-grow: 1;
    order: 1;
}

.modal__paragraph {
    order: 3;
}
```

### Continued development

Work more with Javascript especially on less code more functionality.
